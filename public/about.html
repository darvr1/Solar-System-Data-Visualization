                There are few topics that inspire awe, innovation, and imagination quite like the workings of the universe.
                From science, mathematics, religion, to pop culture, outer space has a tight hold on the human experience.
                This website, created by Dale, Alexandra, and Yejin of Team DayTa, was inspired by the the wonders of our
                Solar System. Each of the eight planets of our Solar System have a page with basic facts, which are also
                represented on the Visualization page. The Visualization graph is a fun way to see the comparisons between
                each planet and how they differ from one another.

                    I am a sophomore pursuing a computer science major and math minor. 
                    Still figuring out my focus in computer science. 
                    Even though I am not a master at either, I really enjoy both.
                    Outside of class, you'll find me trying to code something or playing video games.

                    I am a senior studying computer science and interested in 
                    becoming a data scientist. When I am not studying or in school I am spending time 
                    with my one year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Rosie. We like to go for long walks 
                    and play in Golden Gate Park. If we are not running around outside, 
                    then we cuddle up at home to watch YouTube, read, or do sudoku puzzles.

                    I am a junior majoring in Business with a double major in Computer Science. 
                    I am an exchange student from Korea. Dreaming of becoming a backend developer, I still have a lot to learn. 
                    This is my first time in San Francisco, and I want to experience and explore as much as possible during this period in my life.
